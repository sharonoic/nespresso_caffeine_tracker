Hello Nespresso Lovers.

Once upon a time, a man took too much caffeine. The other day, he died.

I didn't want to die, at least not because of caffeine intoxication, so I created this tracker.

To ensure that the caffeine you take doesn't kill you, this tracker helps you track how much caffeine slips into your body from Nespresso pods.
